## Maintenance mode

This repository is now in maintenance mode and is no longer actively developed. I suggest users migrate to [Gaming Table Player](https://github.com/skepickle/foundryvtt-gaming-table-player), which includes more advanced features and has an active developer.

For those that wish to use **Hide-Sidebars**, its simple design means it will most likely continue to work in future versions. I will periodically check for pull requests and issues.

# Hide-Sidebars

Foundry VTT module that allows the GM to hide sidebars (Chat, Scenes, Items, etc) for players, simplifying the player UI. By default it disables Scenes, Items, Tables, Cards, Playlists, and Compendiums.

Each tab can be toggled in the module settings. Removing the Settings tab for players is possible but not recommended.
